# Zsh Configuration Cleanup - Completed Summary

**Status:** Completed  
**Date:** 2025-07-07  
**Methodology:** Shape Up

## Overview
Successfully completed the zsh configuration cleanup project, which included refactoring the shell configuration files and fixing the Starship prompt initialization issue.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Shell Configuration Refactoring
- Analyzed and documented the existing zsh configuration structure
- Created comprehensive pitch and solution design documents
- Identified areas for improvement in the modular configuration

### 2. Starship Prompt Fix
- **Problem:** Starship prompt wasn't loading automatically on terminal startup
- **Root Cause:** `/opt/homebrew/bin` missing from PATH in `.zshenv`
- **Solution:** Added Homebrew path to `.zshenv` to ensure early availability
- **Result:** Starship now loads correctly on all new terminal sessions

## Key Files Modified
- `/Users/rcogley/.dotfiles/zsh/.zshenv` - Added `/opt/homebrew/bin` to PATH

## Deliverables
1. `zsh-cleanup-pitch.md` - Shape Up pitch document outlining the problem and approach
2. `zsh-cleanup-solution.md` - Detailed solution design with implementation plan
3. Working Starship prompt configuration

## Lessons Learned
- Zsh initialization order is critical: `.zshenv` → `.zprofile` → `.zshrc` → `.zlogin`
- Apple Silicon Macs use `/opt/homebrew/` instead of `/usr/local/` for Homebrew
- PATH availability during early initialization affects command availability

## Next Steps
The refactoring plan documented in the solution design can be implemented incrementally to achieve a cleaner, more maintainable zsh configuration.
