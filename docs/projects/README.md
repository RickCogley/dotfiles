# Aichaku Project Documentation

This directory contains all project documentation organized by status and date.

## Structure

- `active/` - Currently ongoing work
- `done/` - Completed projects

## Naming Convention

`YYYY-MM-DD-[descriptive-kebab-case-name]`

Examples:
- active/2025-01-07-user-authentication
- active/2025-01-07-fix-performance-issues
- done/2025-01-06-global-project-redesign

## What Goes Here

Each project directory should contain:
- STATUS.md - Current status and progress (ALWAYS create this first)
- Planning documents (pitches, specs, backlogs)
- Progress updates
- Metrics and reviews
- CHANGE-LOG.md - Summary when complete

## For Claude Code

When users discuss new work, IMMEDIATELY create a new active-* directory here.
Don't wait to be asked. This is expected behavior.

### Quick Reference
- User says "let's shape X" → Create active-YYYY-MM-DD-shape-X/
- User says "plan sprint" → Create active-YYYY-MM-DD-sprint-planning/
- User says "fix bug" → Create active-YYYY-MM-DD-fix-[bug-description]/
