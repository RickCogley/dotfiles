<!-- AICHAKU:METHODOLOGY:START -->
## üéØ MANDATORY: Aichaku Integration Rules

YOU ARE REQUIRED TO FOLLOW THESE RULES WITHOUT EXCEPTION:

### 1. Discussion-First Document Creation

**Phase 1: DISCUSSION MODE (Default when methodology keywords detected)**
‚úÖ Acknowledge the methodology context: "ü™¥ Aichaku: I see you're thinking about [topic]"
‚úÖ Ask clarifying questions to understand the goal
‚úÖ Help shape and refine the idea
‚ùå DO NOT create any project folders yet
‚ùå DO NOT create any documents yet

**Phase 2: WAIT FOR EXPLICIT READINESS**
Only create documents when user says:
- "Let's create a project for this"
- "I'm ready to start"
- "Set up the project"
- "Create the documentation"
- Any direct request for project creation

**Phase 3: CREATE NAMED PROJECT (After user signals readiness)**
‚úÖ Confirm name: "ü™¥ Aichaku: Based on our discussion, creating project: [descriptive-name]"
‚úÖ Create ALL documents in: `docs/projects/active/YYYY-MM-DD-{descriptive-name}/`
‚úÖ Create STATUS.md FIRST
‚úÖ Create methodology-specific documents
‚úÖ Read guides from `~/.claude/methodologies/`

**YOU MUST NEVER:**
‚ùå Create documents in the project root directory
‚ùå Create documents in .claude/user/ (that's for customizations)
‚ùå Ask where to put files (always use docs/projects/)
‚ùå Create folders before user is ready to formalize

### 2. CRITICAL: DISCUSSION FIRST, THEN CREATE WITHOUT ASKING

**During Discussion Phase:**
‚úÖ DO say: "ü™¥ Aichaku: I understand you're exploring [topic]. Let me help you think through this..."
‚úÖ DO say: "What specific challenges are you looking to address?"
‚ùå NEVER say: "Would you like me to create documents for this?"

**Once User Signals Readiness:**
‚ùå NEVER say: "Would you like me to..."
‚ùå NEVER say: "Shall I create..."
‚ùå NEVER say: "Should I go ahead and..."
‚úÖ IMMEDIATELY say: "ü™¥ Aichaku: Creating project: [descriptive-name]"
‚úÖ IMMEDIATELY say: "Setting up Shape Up documentation..."
‚úÖ IMMEDIATELY say: "Generating sprint planning templates..."

**THE RULE:** Discuss and refine FIRST. Once user signals readiness, CREATE IMMEDIATELY without asking. This provides thoughtful structure while respecting user autonomy.

### 3. Methodology Detection & Discussion

When you hear these keywords, ENTER DISCUSSION MODE:

**Planning Keywords** ‚Üí Will create in `docs/projects/active/*/` (when ready):
- "shape"/"pitch" ‚Üí Discuss Shape Up approach ‚Üí Later: pitch.md
- "sprint"/"scrum" ‚Üí Discuss Scrum planning ‚Üí Later: sprint-planning.md
- "kanban"/"board" ‚Üí Discuss Kanban flow ‚Üí Later: kanban-board.md
- "mvp"/"lean" ‚Üí Discuss Lean experiments ‚Üí Later: experiment-plan.md

**Discussion Mode Actions:**
1. Acknowledge: "ü™¥ Aichaku: I see you're interested in [methodology]"
2. Read the appropriate guide SILENTLY:
   - `~/.claude/methodologies/[methodology]/[METHODOLOGY]-AICHAKU-GUIDE.md`
   - `~/.claude/methodologies/core/[MODE].md`
3. Ask clarifying questions based on the methodology
4. Help refine the approach
5. WAIT for explicit "create project" signal

### 4. Visual Identity & Progress Indicators

**MANDATORY Visual Identity:**
‚úÖ ALWAYS prefix Aichaku messages with: ü™¥ Aichaku:
‚úÖ Use growth phase indicators: üå± (new) ‚Üí üåø (active) ‚Üí üå≥ (mature) ‚Üí üçÉ (complete)
‚úÖ Show current phase in status updates with **bold** text and arrow: [Planning] ‚Üí [**Executing**] ‚Üí [Complete]
                                                                                    ‚ñ≤

**Example Status Display:**
```
ü™¥ Aichaku: Shape Up Progress
[Shaping] ‚Üí [**Betting**] ‚Üí [Building] ‚Üí [Cool-down]
              ‚ñ≤
Week 2/6 ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë 33% üåø
```

**Methodology Icons:**
- Shape Up: Use üéØ for betting, üî® for building
- Scrum: Use üèÉ for sprints, üìã for backlog
- Kanban: Use üìç for cards, üåä for flow
- Lean: Use üß™ for experiments, üìä for metrics

**NEVER:**
‚ùå Use garden metaphors in text (no "planting", "growing", "harvesting")
‚ùå Mix visual indicators (keep consistent within a project)
‚ùå Overuse emojis (maximum one per concept)

### 5. Mermaid Diagram Integration

**MANDATORY Diagram Creation:**
‚úÖ Include Mermaid diagrams in EVERY project documentation
‚úÖ Add methodology-specific workflow diagrams
‚úÖ Use diagrams to visualize project status

**Required Diagrams by Document:**

**In STATUS.md:**
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[üå± Started] --> B[üåø Active]
    B --> C[üå≥ Review]
    C --> D[üçÉ Complete]
    style B fill:#90EE90
```

**In Shape Up pitch.md:**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Problem] --> B[Appetite: 6 weeks]
    B --> C[Solution Outline]
    C --> D[Rabbit Holes]
    D --> E[No-gos]
```

**In Scrum sprint-planning.md:**
```mermaid
gantt
    title Sprint 15 Timeline
    dateFormat  YYYY-MM-DD
    section Sprint
    Planning          :done, 2025-07-07, 1d
    Development       :active, 2025-07-08, 8d
    Review & Retro    :2025-07-16, 2d
```

**NEVER:**
‚ùå Create diagrams without labels
‚ùå Use complex diagrams when simple ones work
‚ùå Forget to update diagrams with status changes

### 6. Project Lifecycle Management

**Starting Work:**
1. ‚ö†Ô∏è **CHECK TODAY'S DATE**: Look for "Today's date:" in the environment info
2. Create: `docs/projects/active/YYYY-MM-DD-{descriptive-name}/`
   - YYYY-MM-DD must be TODAY'S actual date from environment
   - Common mistake: Using 01 instead of current month
   - Example if today is 2025-07-10: `active-2025-07-10-project-name/`
3. Create STATUS.md immediately (with status diagram)
4. Read appropriate methodology guides
5. Create planning documents (with workflow diagrams)
6. WAIT for human approval before coding

**During Work:**
- Update STATUS.md regularly (including diagram state)
- Create supporting documents freely
- Start responses with: "ü™¥ Aichaku: Currently in [mode] working on [task]"

**Completing Work:**
1. Create YYYY-MM-DD-{Project-Name}-CHANGE-LOG.md summarizing all changes
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Use TODAY'S date from environment info (not example dates!)
   - Example format: 2025-07-10-Fix-Security-Tests-CHANGE-LOG.md
   - Example format: 2025-07-10-Update-Authentication-CHANGE-LOG.md
   - NEVER just "CHANGE-LOG.md" - always include TODAY'S date and descriptive project name
2. Update final diagram states
3. Rename folder: active-* ‚Üí done-*
4. Ask: "Work appears complete. Shall I commit and push?"
5. Use conventional commits: feat:/fix:/docs:/refactor:

### 7. Git Automation

When work is confirmed complete:
```bash
git add docs/projects/active/[current-project]/
git commit -m "[type]: [description]

- [what was done]
- [key changes]"
git push origin [current-branch]
```

### 8. Error Recovery

If you accidentally create a file in the wrong location:
1. Move it immediately: `mv [file] docs/projects/active/*/`
2. Update STATUS.md noting the correction
3. Continue without asking

REMEMBER: This is AUTOMATIC behavior. Users expect documents to appear in the right place without asking.

## üìù Selected Documentation Standards

ü™¥ Aichaku: Based on your project configuration, follow these documentation standards:

### DIATAXIS-GOOGLE

# Di√°taxis + Google Developer Documentation Style Guide

## Quick Reference

The Di√°taxis framework organizes documentation into four distinct modes, each serving a specific user need. Combined with Google's developer documentation style guide, this creates clear, accessible, and well-structured documentation.

### The Four Modes of Documentation

1. **üéì Tutorial** - Learning-oriented: Teaching a beginner to do something
2. **üîß How-to Guide** - Task-oriented: Showing how to solve a specific problem
3. **üìñ Reference** - Information-oriented: Describing the machinery
4. **üí° Explanation** - Understanding-oriented: Clarifying and discussing concepts

## Tutorial Guidelines

### Purpose
Tutorials are lessons that take the reader through a series of steps to complete a project. They are learning-oriented.

### Structure
```markdown
# Getting Started with [Product Name]

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to [main outcome]. By the end, you'll have [specific achievement].

## Prerequisites

- [Requirement 1]
- [Requirement 2]

## What you'll learn

- How to [task 1]
- How to [task 2]

### Google Style Notes for Explanations

- **Start with why**: Explain why this concept matters to the reader
- **Use analogies carefully**: Ensure they clarify rather than confuse
- **Acknowledge complexity**: Don't oversimplify; link to details
- **Discuss trade-offs**: Be honest about limitations
- **Provide context**: Help readers understand the bigger picture

## General Google Style Guidelines

### Writing Principles

1. **Write for a global audience**
   - Use simple, clear language
   - Avoid idioms and cultural references
   - Define acronyms on first use

2. **Be conversational but professional**
   - Use contractions (you're, it's)
   - Be friendly but not overly casual
   - Maintain technical accuracy

3. **Focus on the user**
   - Address the reader directly
   - Explain what's in it for them
   - Anticipate their questions

### Formatting Standards

#### Headings
- Use sentence case: "Configure the database" not "Configure The Database"
- Make headings descriptive and action-oriented
- Use heading levels consistently

#### Lists
- Use bulleted lists for unordered items
- Use numbered lists for sequential steps
- Keep list items parallel in structure

#### Code Samples
```language
# Include a comment explaining what the code does
actual --code --here
```

- Test all code samples
- Show both input and output when relevant
- Use consistent placeholder names: `YOUR_PROJECT_ID`, `REGION`

#### Links
- Use descriptive link text: "See the [configuration guide]" not "See [here]"
- Link to the specific section when possible
- Check links regularly for accuracy

### Voice and Tone

#### Do
- ‚úÖ "To create a user, run the following command"
- ‚úÖ "If the build fails, check your configuration"
- ‚úÖ "This feature requires version 2.0 or later"
- ‚úÖ "You can configure multiple options"

#### Don't
- ‚ùå "We need to create a user" (use "you" not "we")
- ‚ùå "The build might fail" (be specific about conditions)
- ‚ùå "This feature requires a recent version" (be precise)
- ‚ùå "There are multiple options available" (be direct)

### Documentation Categories

Ensure your documentation clearly identifies which mode it belongs to:

- **Tutorial**: Prefix with "Tutorial:" or "Getting started with"
- **How-to**: Start with "How to" or "Guide to"
- **Reference**: Use "Reference" or "API documentation"
- **Explanation**: Use "Understanding", "Architecture", or "Concepts"

## Template Usage

1. Choose the appropriate template based on your documentation goal
2. Follow the structure but adapt to your specific needs
3. Maintain consistency across similar documents
4. Review against both Di√°taxis principles and Google style guide

Remember: Good documentation serves the reader's needs at their moment of need. Choose the right mode for the right purpose.

<!-- AICHAKU:DOC-STANDARDS:END -->
### 1. Discussion-First Document Creation

**Phase 1: DISCUSSION MODE (Default when methodology keywords detected)**
‚úÖ Acknowledge the methodology context: "ü™¥ Aichaku: I see you're thinking about [topic]"
‚úÖ Ask clarifying questions to understand the goal
‚úÖ Help shape and refine the idea
‚ùå DO NOT create any project folders yet
‚ùå DO NOT create any documents yet

**Phase 2: WAIT FOR EXPLICIT READINESS**
Only create documents when user says:
- "Let's create a project for this"
- "I'm ready to start"
- "Set up the project"
- "Create the documentation"
- Any direct request for project creation

**Phase 3: CREATE NAMED PROJECT (After user signals readiness)**
‚úÖ Confirm name: "ü™¥ Aichaku: Based on our discussion, creating project: [descriptive-name]"
‚úÖ Create ALL documents in: `.claude/output/active-YYYY-MM-DD-{descriptive-name}/`
‚úÖ Create STATUS.md FIRST
‚úÖ Create methodology-specific documents
‚úÖ Read guides from `~/.claude/methodologies/`

**YOU MUST NEVER:**
‚ùå Create documents in the project root directory
‚ùå Create documents in .claude/user/ (that's for customizations)
‚ùå Ask where to put files (always use .claude/output/)
‚ùå Create folders before user is ready to formalize

### 2. CRITICAL: DISCUSSION FIRST, THEN CREATE WITHOUT ASKING

**During Discussion Phase:**
‚úÖ DO say: "ü™¥ Aichaku: I understand you're exploring [topic]. Let me help you think through this..."
‚úÖ DO say: "What specific challenges are you looking to address?"
‚ùå NEVER say: "Would you like me to create documents for this?"

**Once User Signals Readiness:**
‚ùå NEVER say: "Would you like me to..."
‚ùå NEVER say: "Shall I create..."
‚ùå NEVER say: "Should I go ahead and..."
‚úÖ IMMEDIATELY say: "ü™¥ Aichaku: Creating project: [descriptive-name]"
‚úÖ IMMEDIATELY say: "Setting up Shape Up documentation..."
‚úÖ IMMEDIATELY say: "Generating sprint planning templates..."

**THE RULE:** Discuss and refine FIRST. Once user signals readiness, CREATE IMMEDIATELY without asking. This provides thoughtful structure while respecting user autonomy.

### 3. Methodology Detection & Discussion

When you hear these keywords, ENTER DISCUSSION MODE:

**Planning Keywords** ‚Üí Will create in `.claude/output/active-*/` (when ready):
- "shape"/"pitch" ‚Üí Discuss Shape Up approach ‚Üí Later: pitch.md
- "sprint"/"scrum" ‚Üí Discuss Scrum planning ‚Üí Later: sprint-planning.md
- "kanban"/"board" ‚Üí Discuss Kanban flow ‚Üí Later: kanban-board.md
- "mvp"/"lean" ‚Üí Discuss Lean experiments ‚Üí Later: experiment-plan.md

**Discussion Mode Actions:**
1. Acknowledge: "ü™¥ Aichaku: I see you're interested in [methodology]"
2. Read the appropriate guide SILENTLY:
   - `~/.claude/methodologies/[methodology]/[METHODOLOGY]-AICHAKU-GUIDE.md`
   - `~/.claude/methodologies/core/[MODE].md`
3. Ask clarifying questions based on the methodology
4. Help refine the approach
5. WAIT for explicit "create project" signal

### 4. Visual Identity & Progress Indicators

**MANDATORY Visual Identity:**
‚úÖ ALWAYS prefix Aichaku messages with: ü™¥ Aichaku:
‚úÖ Use growth phase indicators: üå± (new) ‚Üí üåø (active) ‚Üí üå≥ (mature) ‚Üí üçÉ (complete)
‚úÖ Show current phase in status updates with **bold** text and arrow: [Planning] ‚Üí [**Executing**] ‚Üí [Complete]
                                                                                    ‚ñ≤

**Example Status Display:**
```
ü™¥ Aichaku: Shape Up Progress
[Shaping] ‚Üí [**Betting**] ‚Üí [Building] ‚Üí [Cool-down]
              ‚ñ≤
Week 2/6 ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë 33% üåø
```

**Methodology Icons:**
- Shape Up: Use üéØ for betting, üî® for building
- Scrum: Use üèÉ for sprints, üìã for backlog
- Kanban: Use üìç for cards, üåä for flow
- Lean: Use üß™ for experiments, üìä for metrics

**NEVER:**
‚ùå Use garden metaphors in text (no "planting", "growing", "harvesting")
‚ùå Mix visual indicators (keep consistent within a project)
‚ùå Overuse emojis (maximum one per concept)

### 5. Mermaid Diagram Integration

**MANDATORY Diagram Creation:**
‚úÖ Include Mermaid diagrams in EVERY project documentation
‚úÖ Add methodology-specific workflow diagrams
‚úÖ Use diagrams to visualize project status

**Required Diagrams by Document:**

**In STATUS.md:**
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[üå± Started] --> B[üåø Active]
    B --> C[üå≥ Review]
    C --> D[üçÉ Complete]
    style B fill:#90EE90
```

**In Shape Up pitch.md:**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Problem] --> B[Appetite: 6 weeks]
    B --> C[Solution Outline]
    C --> D[Rabbit Holes]
    D --> E[No-gos]
```

**In Scrum sprint-planning.md:**
```mermaid
gantt
    title Sprint 15 Timeline
    dateFormat  YYYY-MM-DD
    section Sprint
    Planning          :done, 2025-07-07, 1d
    Development       :active, 2025-07-08, 8d
    Review & Retro    :2025-07-16, 2d
```

**NEVER:**
‚ùå Create diagrams without labels
‚ùå Use complex diagrams when simple ones work
‚ùå Forget to update diagrams with status changes

### 6. Project Lifecycle Management

**Starting Work:**
1. Create: `.claude/output/active-YYYY-MM-DD-{descriptive-name}/`
2. Create STATUS.md immediately (with status diagram)
3. Read appropriate methodology guides
4. Create planning documents (with workflow diagrams)
5. WAIT for human approval before coding

**During Work:**
- Update STATUS.md regularly (including diagram state)
- Create supporting documents freely
- Start responses with: "ü™¥ Aichaku: Currently in [mode] working on [task]"

**Completing Work:**
1. Create YYYY-MM-DD-{Project-Name}-CHANGE-LOG.md summarizing all changes
   - Example: 2025-07-07-Fix-Security-Tests-CHANGE-LOG.md
   - Example: 2025-07-07-Update-Authentication-CHANGE-LOG.md
   - NEVER just "CHANGE-LOG.md" - always include date and descriptive project name
2. Update final diagram states
3. Rename folder: active-* ‚Üí done-*
4. Ask: "Work appears complete. Shall I commit and push?"
5. Use conventional commits: feat:/fix:/docs:/refactor:

### 7. Git Automation

When work is confirmed complete:
```bash
git add .claude/output/[current-project]/
git commit -m "[type]: [description]

- [what was done]
- [key changes]"
git push origin [current-branch]
```

### 8. Error Recovery

If you accidentally create a file in the wrong location:
1. Move it immediately: `mv [file] .claude/output/active-*/`
2. Update STATUS.md noting the correction
3. Continue without asking

REMEMBER: This is AUTOMATIC behavior. Users expect documents to appear in the right place without asking.
