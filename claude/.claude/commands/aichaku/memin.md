# Load Memory Files

I'll load and analyze the relevant memory files for this session.

## 1. Global Memory
Loading the global memory file that applies to all projects:

@~/.claude/CLAUDE.md

## 2. Project Memory  
Checking for project-specific memory:

@CLAUDE.md

## Summary

Based on the memory files loaded, I'll summarize what I've learned, particularly:
- Rules about git commits and PR descriptions
- Coding standards and conventions
- Security requirements (OWASP, InfoSec)
- Project-specific guidelines
