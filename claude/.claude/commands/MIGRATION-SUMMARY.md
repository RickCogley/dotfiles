# Claude Commands Migration Summary

## Migration Details
- **Date**: 2025-07-14
- **Migration Type**: Legacy commands to MCP (Model Context Protocol) format
- **Backup Location**: Original commands preserved with `.bak` extension

## Commands Migrated

The following 10 commands were successfully migrated to the new MCP format:

1. **analyze-project** → `mcp__aichaku-reviewer__analyze_project`
   - Analyzes project structure, languages, architecture, and dependencies
   
2. **create-doc-template** → `mcp__aichaku-reviewer__create_doc_template`
   - Creates documentation template files for tutorials, how-tos, references, etc.
   
3. **generate-documentation** → `mcp__aichaku-reviewer__generate_documentation`
   - Generates comprehensive documentation following selected standards
   
4. **get-standards** → `mcp__aichaku-reviewer__get_standards`
   - Gets currently selected standards for the project
   
5. **get-statistics** → `mcp__aichaku-reviewer__get_statistics`
   - Gets usage statistics and analytics for MCP tool usage
   
6. **repo-list** → `mcp__github-operations__repo_list`
   - Lists user repositories
   
7. **review-file** → `mcp__aichaku-reviewer__review_file`
   - Reviews a file for security, standards, and methodology compliance
   
8. **review-methodology** → `mcp__aichaku-reviewer__review_methodology`
   - Checks if project follows selected methodology patterns
   
9. **run-list** → `mcp__github-operations__run_list`
   - Lists GitHub Actions workflow runs
   
10. **run-view** → `mcp__github-operations__run_view`
    - Views GitHub Actions workflow run details

## Benefits of the New MCP Format

### 1. **Standardized Protocol**
- MCP provides a consistent interface for all tools
- Better integration with Claude's capabilities
- Improved error handling and validation

### 2. **Enhanced Type Safety**
- Proper parameter validation
- Clear type definitions for inputs and outputs
- Better error messages

### 3. **Automatic Discovery**
- Tools are automatically discovered by Claude
- No manual registration required
- Seamless updates when new tools are added

### 4. **Better Documentation**
- Each tool has built-in description
- Parameter documentation included
- Examples and usage patterns

### 5. **Server-Based Architecture**
- Tools run as separate MCP servers
- Better isolation and security
- Can be updated independently

## How to Use the New Commands

The new MCP commands are automatically available in Claude. Simply use them by their new names:

### Examples:

**Analyze a project:**
```
Use mcp__aichaku-reviewer__analyze_project with projectPath: "/path/to/project"
```

**Review a file:**
```
Use mcp__aichaku-reviewer__review_file with file: "/path/to/file.ts"
```

**List repositories:**
```
Use mcp__github-operations__repo_list
```

**Generate documentation:**
```
Use mcp__aichaku-reviewer__generate_documentation with projectPath: "/path/to/project"
```

### Key Differences:
1. Commands now use the `mcp__` prefix
2. Server name is included (e.g., `aichaku-reviewer`, `github-operations`)
3. Parameters are passed as named arguments
4. No need to manually load or configure commands

## Legacy Command Backups

All original command files have been preserved with a `.bak` extension in case you need to reference them:
- `analyze-project.md.bak`
- `create-doc-template.md.bak`
- `generate-documentation.md.bak`
- etc.

These backups are located in the same `~/.claude/commands/` directory.

## Next Steps

1. The new MCP commands are immediately available for use
2. No action required - Claude will automatically use the new format
3. Legacy backups can be safely deleted once you're comfortable with the new system
4. Check MCP server logs at `~/.claude/logs/` if you encounter any issues
