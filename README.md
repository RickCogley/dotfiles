# Rick Cogley's Dotfiles

A comprehensive, modular dotfiles repository using GNU Stow for symlink management, 
designed for macOS development environments with security and maintainability in mind.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
cd $HOME
git clone https://github.com/RickCogley/dotfiles.git .dotfiles
cd .dotfiles

# Apply configurations
stow git zsh vim

# Set up your private configuration
cp ~/.gitconfig.local.template ~/.gitconfig.local
$EDITOR ~/.gitconfig.local  # Add your GPG key and other secrets
```

## What's Included

- **Git**: Comprehensive git configuration with secure secret management

## Why This Approach?

After trying various dotfile management methods, GNU Stow emerged as the ideal solution:
- **Simple and reliable** - Just creates standard symlinks
- **No dependencies** - Works anywhere git and stow are available
- **Transparent** - Easy to understand and debug
- **Flexible** - Apply configurations selectively

For systems without git/stow, rsync provides a reliable fallback option.

## Philosophy

These dotfiles prioritize:
- **Security** over convenience
- **Simplicity** over features  
- **Documentation** over assumptions
- **Modularity** over monolithic configs

## Contributing

This is a personal configuration repository, but the documentation and patterns 
may be useful for others building their own dotfile systems. Feel free to:
- Use any patterns or documentation for your own setup
- Submit issues for documentation improvements
- Share feedback on the architecture approach
