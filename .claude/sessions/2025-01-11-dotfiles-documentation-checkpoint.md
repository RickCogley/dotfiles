# Dotfiles Documentation Checkpoint
**Date**: 2025-01-11  
**Project**: Dotfiles Repository Documentation

## Summary

Created comprehensive project documentation following Diátaxis + Google Developer Documentation Style Guide standards, with improvements based on Aichaku linting feedback.

## Work Completed

### 1. Git Configuration Cleanup
- **Fixed**: Removed duplicate `.claude/settings.local.json` entries in `git/.config/git/ignore`
- **Cleaned**: Removed all `.zwc` compiled Zsh files from the repository
- **Note**: GPG signing key update pending user decision

### 2. Documentation Structure Created

```

```

### 3. Documentation Standards Applied

#### Diátaxis Framework
- **Tutorials**: Learning-oriented guides with prerequisites and expected outcomes
- **How-to Guides**: Task-oriented recipes with multiple solution options
- **Reference**: Information-oriented technical descriptions
- **Explanations**: Understanding-oriented discussions with context and background

#### Google Style Guide
- Sentence case for all headings (not Title Case)
- Present tense throughout
- Active voice preferred
- Lines wrapped at ~100 characters
- No assumptions about difficulty ("simple", "easy" avoided)

### 4. Aichaku Linting Improvements

Based on linting feedback, the following improvements were made:

#### Major Fixes
- Added required Context and Discussion sections to explanation documents
- Fixed heading hierarchy (no skipping levels)
- Separated instructional content from conceptual explanations
- Fixed table formatting and removed double spaces

#### Style Improvements
- Added periods to full sentences in lists
- Improved line wrapping for readability
- Replaced passive voice with active voice
- Used consistent present tense
- Removed forbidden words suggesting difficulty

### 5. Key Documentation Features

- **Mermaid Diagrams**: Visual representations of architecture and workflows
- **Code Examples**: Practical, tested examples throughout
- **Troubleshooting Sections**: Common problems and solutions
- **Security Focus**: Dedicated security documentation and considerations
- **Cross-References**: Links between related documents

## Pending Items

1. **Git Configuration**: User needs to decide on GPG signing key configuration
2. **Commit Changes**: Documentation ready to be committed when user is ready
3. **Additional Linting**: Some reference and how-to documents could benefit from further refinement

## Files Modified

### Staged Changes
None (awaiting user decision on commits)

### Modified Files
- `git/.config/git/ignore` - Cleaned up duplicate entries
- `git/.gitconfig` - GPG key configuration pending
- `.claude/settings.local.json` - Local settings update

### Untracked Files
- `docs/` - Complete documentation directory
- `.claude/sessions/` - This checkpoint file

## Next Steps

1. Resolve GPG signing key configuration
2. Stage and commit documentation: `git add docs/`
3. Consider running `aichaku docs:lint` again after any future edits
4. Update main README.md to reference new documentation

## Notes

- Documentation follows modular structure for easy maintenance
- Each document type serves a specific user need per Diátaxis
- Linting revealed common formatting issues across documents
- Future documentation should follow these established patterns
