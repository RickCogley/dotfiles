# Claude Session Summary - 2025-07-07

## Session Overview
Fixed Starship prompt not loading automatically on terminal startup for macOS with Homebrew on Apple Silicon.

## Main Accomplishments
1. **Diagnosed Starship Installation Issue**
   - Confirmed Starship was properly installed via Homebrew at `/opt/homebrew/bin/starship`
   - Verified initialization code was present in `.zshrc`
   - Identified that the prompt worked with manual shell reload but not on terminal startup

2. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - Discovered `/opt/homebrew/bin` was not in PATH during early shell initialization
   - `.zshenv` loads before `.zshrc` and sets up initial PATH
   - Starship initialization in `.zshrc` couldn't find the `starship` command

3. **Implemented Solution**
   - Added `/opt/homebrew/bin` to PATH in `.zshenv`
   - This ensures Starship is available when `.zshrc` attempts to initialize it

## Key Technical Decisions
- Modified `.zshenv` rather than moving Starship initialization later in `.zshrc`
- Preserved existing PATH setup logic while adding Homebrew path early
- Maintained compatibility with existing shell configuration

## Files Modified
1. `/Users/rcogley/.dotfiles/zsh/.zshenv`
   - Added `/opt/homebrew/bin` to the PATH array (line 14)

## Problems Solved
- Starship prompt now loads automatically when opening new terminal windows
- Resolved PATH availability timing issue in Zsh initialization sequence

## Commands and Tools Used
- `which starship` - Located Starship installation
- `starship --version` - Verified installation
- `exec zsh -l` - Forced login shell reload
- `starship init zsh` - Generated initialization script for debugging

## Lessons Learned
1. **Zsh Initialization Order Matters**
   - `.zshenv` → `.zprofile` → `.zshrc` → `.zlogin`
   - Commands needed early in initialization must be accessible via `.zshenv` PATH

2. **Apple Silicon Homebrew Location**
   - Homebrew on Apple Silicon installs to `/opt/homebrew/` instead of `/usr/local/`
   - This path must be explicitly added for early shell initialization

3. **Debugging Shell Issues**
   - `exec zsh -l` provides clean login shell for testing
   - Checking both installation location and PATH availability is crucial

## Additional Notes
- User discovered custom slash commands in Claude Code
- Slash commands are defined in `~/.dotfiles/claude/.claude/settings.json`
- Corrected command usage from `/save-session` to `/session-save`
