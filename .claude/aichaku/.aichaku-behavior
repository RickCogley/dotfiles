# 🎯 Quick Reference for Claude Code

## Before ANY work:
1. Check docs/projects/active/ for existing project directories
2. Create new YYYY-MM-DD-{name} directory for new work
3. ALWAYS create STATUS.md first
4. Read methodology guides from ~/.claude/aichaku/methodologies/

## Key Behaviors:
✅ Documents ALWAYS go in docs/projects/active/*/
✅ Update STATUS.md after each work session
✅ Create documents without asking permission
✅ Move to docs/projects/done/ when complete

❌ NEVER create documents in project root
❌ NEVER use .claude/user/ for output
❌ NEVER wait for permission to create standard docs
❌ NEVER proceed with implementation without approval

## Project Structure:
- docs/projects/active/ → Work in progress
- docs/projects/done/ → Completed work

IMPORTANT: Creating proper structure is AUTOMATIC, not optional.
