# ðŸš¨ AICHAKU RULES REMINDER

## Before creating ANY file, check:

1. âœ… Is it going in `docs/projects/active/*/`?
2. âœ… Does STATUS.md exist there?
3. âœ… Have I updated STATUS.md recently?

If any answer is NO â†’ FIX IT FIRST!

## Quick Fixes:

### Wrong location?
```bash
mv [file] docs/projects/active/[current-project]/
```

### No STATUS.md?
Create it immediately with project info.

### Not sure where to put files?
ALWAYS: `docs/projects/active/YYYY-MM-DD-{project-name}/`

## Remember:
- This is AUTOMATIC behavior
- Users expect files in the right place
- No asking, just doing
