# Shape Up

**BEST FOR**: Features with unclear solutions, fixed timeline projects, avoiding
scope creep

**TRIGGERS**: "shape", "appetite", "pitch", "betting table", "6 weeks"

## Core Rules

### Planning Rules

- Problems before solutions
- Appetite = 2 or 6 weeks only
- Shape work to rough level
- Identify rabbit holes
- Explicit no-gos

### Execution Rules

- Fixed time, variable scope
- No extensions ever
- Team has autonomy
- Ship or stop at deadline

### Improvement Rules

- Measure cycles completed
- Track appetite accuracy
- Learn from bets lost

## Quick Templates

### Pitch (Planning Output)

```
Problem: [User problem]
Appetite: [2/6 weeks]
Solution: [Rough sketch]
Rabbit holes: [What to avoid]
No-gos: [What we're NOT doing]
```

### Cycle Plan (After Betting)

```
Bet 1: [Feature] - [Team] - [Appetite]
Bet 2: [Feature] - [Team] - [Appetite]
Not betting: [What we're letting go]
```

### Progress Check

```
Day [X] of [Appetite]:
Done: [Completed]
Now: [In progress]
Risk: [Any concerns]
```

## Context Adaptations

**Solo**: Skip betting ceremony, direct shape â†’ build **Team**: Full process
with betting table **Urgent**: Not suitable - use Kanban instead

## Key Decisions

1. **Setting Appetite**
   - 2 weeks: Single improvement
   - 6 weeks: New capability
   - Too big? Break apart or reject

2. **During Shaping**
   - Keep solution rough
   - Think breadboards not mockups
   - Focus on unknowns

3. **While Building**
   - Cut scope not quality
   - Stop at deadline
   - No "just one more day"
