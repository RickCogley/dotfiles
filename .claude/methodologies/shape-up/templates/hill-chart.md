## Understanding the Hill

**Left side (Uphill)**: Problem-solving mode

- "I'm still working out the approach"
- "I need to understand how this fits together"
- "Exploring different options"

**Top (Peak)**: The "aha" moment

- "Now I see how to do this"
- "The approach is clear"

**Right side (Downhill)**: Execution mode

- "I know what to do, just need to build it"
- "It's just a matter of time now"
- "Wiring up the implementation"

---

## Scopes Progress

### ‚óâ A: [Scope Name]

**Position**: 20% - Early uphill **Status**: Exploring the problem space

Currently figuring out:

- How to approach [specific unknown]
- Best way to handle [technical challenge]
- Understanding existing [system/code]

Next steps:

- Spike on [technical approach]
- Validate assumptions about [concern]

---

### ‚óâ B: [Scope Name]

**Position**: 40% - Climbing uphill **Status**: Getting clarity on approach

Currently figuring out:

- [Specific challenge being solved]
- [Design decision being made]

Next steps:

- Finalize approach for [component]
- Start basic implementation

---

### ‚óâ C: [Scope Name]

**Position**: 50% - At the peak **Status**: Just cracked it! Know what to do

The solution:

- [Clear approach decided]
- [Key insight gained]

Execution plan:

- [ ] Build [component 1]
- [ ] Wire up [component 2]
- [ ] Test [integration]

---

### ‚óâ D: [Scope Name]

**Position**: 75% - Rolling downhill **Status**: Pure execution, no unknowns

Building:

- [x] Core functionality complete
- [ ] Polish UI elements
- [ ] Add error handling
- [ ] Write tests

---

### ‚óâ E: [Scope Name]

**Position**: 100% - Complete ‚úÖ **Status**: Done and integrated

Completed:

- All functionality working
- Tests passing
- Integrated with other scopes

---

## Overall Status

**Confidence Level**: üü¢ High / üü° Medium / üî¥ Low

**Key Risks**:

- ‚ö†Ô∏è [Scope that's stuck uphill]
- ‚ö†Ô∏è [External dependency]

**Potential Cuts** (if needed):

- Could simplify [scope] by [approach]
- Could defer [nice-to-have feature]

**Integration Notes**:

- [How scopes connect]
- [Order dependencies]
