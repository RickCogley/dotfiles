## Phase Transition Checklist

**Before moving to BUILDING phase, verify:**

- [ ] All bets have assigned teams
- [ ] Each bet has clear success criteria
- [ ] Appetites are realistic for the scope
- [ ] Teams understand they have full autonomy
- [ ] Circuit breaker is clear: ship in 6 weeks or stop

**Claude Code Reminder**: This cycle plan should be saved to
`.claude/output/[status-YYYYMM-projectname]/cycle-plan.md`. Teams can now begin
building with full autonomy.
