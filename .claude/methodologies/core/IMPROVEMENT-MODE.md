# Improvement Mode

## 🏗️ PROJECT STRUCTURE - ALWAYS START HERE

When you hear any of these:

- "How are we doing?" / "Let's review..."
- "Retrospective..." / "What's working?"
- "Improve..." / "Optimize..." / "Refactor..."
- "Measure..." / "Metrics..." / "Performance..."

CONTINUE in existing folder OR create new: 📁
`.claude/output/active-{YYYY-MM-DD}-{descriptive-name}/` └── STATUS.md (update
to IMPROVEMENT mode)

This is automatic - users shouldn't need to ask!

**ACTIVATES WHEN**: User wants to review, reflect, measure, or improve process

**TRIGGERS**: "how are we doing", "retrospective", "metrics", "what's working",
"review"

## Quick Start

```
MEASURE performance → IDENTIFY patterns → SUGGEST improvements
```

## Universal Improvement Flow

1. **COLLECT DATA**
   ```
   What: Metrics for active methodology
   Period: Last sprint/week/cycle
   Context: Team size, work type
   ```

2. **ANALYZE PATTERNS**
   ```
   ✅ What's working well
   ⚠️ What needs attention
   📈 Trends over time
   ```

3. **SUGGEST ACTIONS**
   ```
   Quick wins: [immediate improvements]
   Experiments: [things to try]
   Stop doing: [waste to eliminate]
   ```

## Methodology Metrics

### Shape Up

```
MEASURE:
- Cycles completed on time
- Appetite accuracy 
- Bets won vs lost
- Cooldown effectiveness

HEALTHY:
✅ 80%+ on-time delivery
✅ Rare appetite extensions
✅ Clear no-gos preventing scope creep
```

### Scrum

```
MEASURE:
- Velocity trend
- Sprint commitment accuracy
- Burndown patterns
- Escaped defects

HEALTHY:
✅ Stable velocity ±10%
✅ 85%+ commitment met
✅ Consistent burndown
```

### Kanban

```
MEASURE:
- Cycle time trend
- Throughput stability
- WIP limit violations
- Blocker frequency

HEALTHY:
✅ Decreasing cycle time
✅ Predictable throughput
✅ Rare WIP violations
```

### Lean

```
MEASURE:
- Time to validate
- Pivot frequency
- Learning velocity
- Waste eliminated

HEALTHY:
✅ Fast experiment cycles
✅ Clear learning outcomes
✅ Decreasing waste
```

## Quick Assessments

### "How are we doing?"

```
Last [period] summary:
✅ Delivered: [X items/points]
📊 Velocity: [trend arrow]
⏱️ Cycle time: [X days average]
🚫 Blockers: [X resolved]

Overall health: [Good/Caution/Needs attention]
Top insight: [Most important pattern]
```

### "What should we improve?"

```
Based on data, prioritize:

1. 🎯 [Biggest impact item]
   Why: [Data supporting this]
   Try: [Specific action]
   
2. 🔧 [Quick fix]
   Why: [Easy win]
   Try: [Simple change]
```

## Retrospective Formats

### Solo Reflection (5 min)

```
This [period] I:
✅ Succeeded at: [wins]
🤔 Struggled with: [challenges]
💡 Will try: [improvement]
```

### Team Retro (30 min)

```
1. Data review (5 min)
2. What went well? (10 min)
3. What was difficult? (10 min)
4. Actions for next cycle (5 min)

Output: 1-3 specific actions
```

### Continuous Improvement

```
Weekly metrics check:
□ Review dashboard
□ Note trends
□ Adjust one thing
□ Document result
```

## Pattern Recognition

### Velocity Issues

```
SYMPTOM: Declining delivery
CHECK: 
- Complexity increasing?
- Team capacity changed?
- Technical debt growing?
- Process overhead?
```

### Quality Issues

```
SYMPTOM: More defects/rework
CHECK:
- Rushing to meet deadlines?
- Skipping quality steps?
- Unclear requirements?
- Missing tests?
```

### Flow Issues

```
SYMPTOM: Work getting stuck
CHECK:
- Bottleneck location?
- Dependencies external?
- WIP limits right?
- Skills gap?
```

## Improvement Experiments

### Small (Try immediately)

```
"Let's try [change] for one [cycle]"
- Adjust WIP limit by 1
- Add 5-min daily check
- Use new template
```

### Medium (One cycle)

```
"This [cycle] we'll experiment with..."
- New estimation method
- Different pairing rotation
- Adjusted ceremonies
```

### Large (Multiple cycles)

```
"Consider switching to..."
- Different methodology
- New team structure
- Major process change
```

## Health Indicators

### 🟢 Healthy

- Consistent delivery
- Happy team
- Few surprises
- Continuous learning

### 🟡 Caution

- Irregular patterns
- Some frustration
- Repeated issues
- Stagnant metrics

### 🔴 Needs Help

- Missing commitments
- Team conflict
- Many blockers
- Declining metrics

## Quick Wins Library

### For any methodology:

- Visualize work better
- Reduce meeting time
- Clarify definitions
- Celebrate successes
- Remove one step

### Methodology-specific:

- Shape Up: Tighter no-gos
- Scrum: Shorter standups
- Kanban: Lower WIP limits
- XP: More pairing
- Lean: Faster experiments

## Remember

Improvement Mode is about learning from data, not blame. Focus on system
improvements, not individual performance. Small, continuous improvements beat
big changes.
