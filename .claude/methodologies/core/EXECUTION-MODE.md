# Execution Mode

## üèóÔ∏è PROJECT STRUCTURE - ALWAYS START HERE

When you hear any of these:

- "Let's build..." / "Implement..." / "Code..."
- "Create..." / "Develop..." / "Make..."
- "Fix this bug..." / "Add feature..."
- "Start working on..." / "Let's do this..."

IMMEDIATELY create (if not exists): üìÅ
`.claude/output/active-{YYYY-MM-DD}-{descriptive-name}/` ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ STATUS.md

This is automatic - users shouldn't need to ask!

**ACTIVATES WHEN**: User ready to build, implement, code, or complete work

**TRIGGERS**: "build", "implement", "let's do this", "start coding", "execute"

## Quick Start

```
LOAD plan ‚Üí APPLY constraints ‚Üí EXECUTE work ‚Üí REPORT progress
```

## Universal Execution Flow

1. **LOAD CONTEXT**
   ```
   What: [From plan or user]
   How: [Methodology constraints]
   Who: [Solo or team]
   ```

2. **EXECUTE WITH CONSTRAINTS**
   ```
   Shape Up ‚Üí Respect appetite, no scope creep
   Scrum ‚Üí Stay within sprint, update board
   Kanban ‚Üí Respect WIP limits, pull only
   XP ‚Üí Test first, pair if specified
   ```

3. **REPORT PROGRESS**
   ```
   ‚úÖ Completed: [what's done]
   üöß In Progress: [what's active]
   üö´ Blocked: [what's stuck + why]
   ```

## Methodology Constraints

### Shape Up Execution

```
RULES:
- Stop at appetite limit (no extensions)
- No new scope after betting
- Build exactly what was shaped
- Ship or stop, no in-between

PROGRESS:
"Day 3 of 10: Auth flow complete, starting preferences"
```

### Scrum Execution

```
RULES:
- Complete sprint commitment
- Update board daily
- No additions mid-sprint
- Definition of Done mandatory

PROGRESS:
Daily standup format:
- Did: [yesterday]
- Doing: [today]
- Blocked: [impediments]
```

### Kanban Execution

```
RULES:
- Pull only when capacity
- Respect WIP limits absolutely
- Update board immediately
- Finish before starting

PROGRESS:
"Moved #123 to Review, pulling #456 from Ready"
```

### XP Execution

```
RULES:
- Write test first
- Make it pass
- Refactor
- Integrate frequently

PATTERN:
üî¥ RED ‚Üí üü¢ GREEN ‚Üí üîµ REFACTOR ‚Üí ‚úÖ COMMIT
```

## Context Adaptations

### Solo Execution

```
- Direct implementation
- Self-review patterns
- Simplified reporting
- Fast decision making
```

### Team Execution

```
- Coordinate handoffs
- Update shared board
- Communicate blockers
- Sync at boundaries
```

### Urgent Execution

```
- Minimal process
- Focus on delivery
- Document after
- Communicate status
```

## Common Patterns

### Starting Work

```
‚úÖ Ready to start [task name]
Approach: [brief strategy]
Estimated: [time/complexity]
First step: [specific action]
```

### Hitting a Blocker

```
üö´ BLOCKED on [task]
Issue: [specific problem]
Need: [what would unblock]
Meanwhile: [alternative work]
```

### Completing Work

```
‚úÖ COMPLETE: [task name]
What: [brief summary]
Testing: [how verified]
Next: [logical next task]
```

## Quick Actions

### "Just build it"

```
Detected: Simple task, solo context
Skipping: Formal planning
Approach: Direct implementation
Constraint: [Methodology-specific limit]
Starting: Now
```

### "Implement the plan"

```
Loading: [plan document]
Tasks: [1, 2, 3...]
Order: Sequential/Parallel
Constraints: [from methodology]
First task: Starting now
```

### "Fix this bug"

```
Mode: Kanban flow
Priority: [Urgent/High/Normal]
WIP check: [Current capacity]
Action: [Pull/Queue/Defer]
```

## Progress Tracking

### Minimal (Solo)

```
‚ñ° ‚ñ° ‚ñ° ‚ñ† ‚ñ† ‚ñ† ‚ñ† ‚ñ† (37% complete)
```

### Detailed (Team)

```
Sprint Progress: Day 3 of 10
- Completed: 5 points
- In Progress: 8 points  
- Remaining: 21 points
- Velocity: On track
```

### Continuous (Kanban)

```
This week: 12 items completed
Average cycle time: 2.3 days
Current WIP: 5 of 6 (near limit)
```

## Quality Checks

Before marking complete:

```
‚ñ° Meets requirements
‚ñ° Tests pass (if applicable)
‚ñ° Code reviewed (if team)
‚ñ° Documentation updated
‚ñ° Ready for next stage
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

‚ùå Starting without clear requirements ‚ùå Ignoring methodology constraints\
‚ùå Silent struggles with blockers ‚ùå Scope creep during execution ‚ùå Skipping
quality checks

## Remember

Execution Mode is about getting things done within constraints. Focus on
progress, communicate blockers, maintain quality.
