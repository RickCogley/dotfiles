# Lean

**BEST FOR**: Startups, MVPs, experimentation, uncertainty, learning fast

**TRIGGERS**: "MVP", "lean", "experiment", "validate", "pivot"

## Core Rules

### Planning Rules

- Hypotheses over requirements
- Minimum viable everything
- Measure what matters
- Plan to learn, not build

### Execution Rules

- Build only to test hypothesis
- Ship as soon as learnable
- Automate everything possible
- Cut features ruthlessly

### Improvement Rules

- Pivot based on data
- Eliminate waste constantly
- Shorten cycle times
- Learn from every experiment

## Quick Templates

### Experiment Plan

```
Hypothesis: [What we believe]
Test: [Minimum way to validate]
Measure: [Key metric]
Success: [Clear threshold]
Timeline: [Days not months]
```

### MVP Definition

```
Problem: [User pain point]
Riskiest assumption: [What might be wrong]
MVP features:
- [Absolute minimum 1]
- [Absolute minimum 2]
NOT doing: [Everything else]
```

### Learning Report

```
Tested: [What we tried]
Result: [What happened]
Learning: [What we now know]
Next: [Pivot or persevere]
```

## Context Adaptations

**Startup**: Full build-measure-learn cycle **Enterprise**: Lean experiments
within constraints **Technical**: Spike solutions, POCs

## Key Decisions

1. **MVP Scope**
   - Can we test with less?
   - Is this assumption critical?
   - Could we fake it first?

2. **Pivot Triggers**
   - Users don't care
   - Can't find market
   - Better opportunity found

3. **Waste to Cut**
   - Unused features
   - Long meetings
   - Detailed plans
   - Perfect code
