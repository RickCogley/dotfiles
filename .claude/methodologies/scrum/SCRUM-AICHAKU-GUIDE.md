## Context Adaptations

**Solo**: Mini-sprints (1 week), skip ceremonies **Small Team**: Lightweight
ceremonies, combine roles **Large Team**: Full ceremonies, clear roles

## Key Decisions

1. **Sprint Length**
   - 1 week: Rapid feedback
   - 2 weeks: Most common
   - 3-4 weeks: Complex work

2. **During Sprint**
   - Protect team from changes
   - Swarm on blockers
   - Cut scope if needed

3. **Quality Gates**
   - Code reviewed
   - Tests written
   - Demo ready
   - Deployed to staging
